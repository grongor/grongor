# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend/system software developer since ever (professionally since circa 2008), currently working for [CDN77](https://www.cdn77.com).

I love to dive deep into things most people even don't know to exist and write future-proof and performant code, mostly in Go, PHP, Java, and Python.

I'd like to add Rust to this repertoire, I just didn't find enough time yet. ðŸ˜ž

I know my way around Linux quite well (I consider myself a DevOps guy), definitely better than the average developer, and I can write all kinds of incredibly scary shell scripts.

I designed and managed complete CI/CD environments/pipelines/templates (TeamCity, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ...), wrote a custom BGP server (and complete monitoring solution around it), helped build a monitoring/management application that handles thousands of devices (servers, routers, DWDMs, ...) and all the data they produce/gather (critical tool for the network team), and...many other things I can't remember right now. ðŸ™‚

I actively contribute to the OSS community and maintain a few repositories myself.
